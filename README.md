# Overview

The Jelfs group has recently developed Web-BO, a GUI to support Bayesian Optimisation for chemical optimisation
tasks. Web-BO is a modular platform that does not require any coding experience to interface with and apply BO
algorithms to chemical optimisation applications. Presently, Web-BO supports simple chemical optimisation tasks
– where one parameter is being optimised sequentially.

Through this work, we will further develop and maintain Web-BO – specifically, we will extend its utility to include i) multi-objective optimisation tasks, where we are able to optimise over more than one parameter (e.g. we want to maximise yield, but limit the cost of reagents) ii) additional surrogate model options (i.e. incorporate additional ML models within the framework). 

We will demonstrate the new functionality via several materials optimisation case studies, including for target property optimisation and materials design.
